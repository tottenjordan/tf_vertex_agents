## Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI)

> If not familiar with GPI, refer to [chapter 4](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/node40.html) of Sutton and Bartoâ€™s book, [Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/the-book.html)

* GPI refers to a general RL framework that uses value functions to organize and structure the search for better policies
* Specifically, GPI describes two interacting processes: (i) [policy evaluation](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/node41.html) and (ii) [policy improvement](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/node42.html), that eventually converge on the optimal policy and value functions as an agent interacts with an environment
